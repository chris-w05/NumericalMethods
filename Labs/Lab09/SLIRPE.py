    A function that solves for all slopes of inputs and
    can be used as an input argument into RK4 function
    Inputs:
    ‚Ä¢ t = a time input index that tracks which time iteration you are on to iterate the temperature forcing
    ‚Ä¢ y = a vector for each of the primary variables in Equation (1)
    ‚Ä¢ params = all parameters required to evaluate Equation (1) including:
        ‚Ä¢ beta_max = the max rate of colony growth/new infections
        ‚Ä¢ mu_L = the inverse of the instantaneous latent period calculated using Equation (9)
        ‚Ä¢ mu_I = the inverse of the duration of the infectious period (a constant)
        ‚Ä¢ K = the rate of new infections from external sources (a constant)
        ‚Ä¢ T = an array of air temperature
        ‚Ä¢ ùëá_min = a scalar value that sets the minimum temperature for plant growth
        ‚Ä¢ T_max = a scalar value that sets the maximum temperature for plant growth
